# oneClick-Installer

this is a one click installer supporting in modelsaber.com and beatsaver.com
i made it because for some reason oneclickinstaller didnt work for me anymore trough the BeatSaberModManager
i copied some of the code from their project and fixed it made simple gui using metroframework and animations with timers
to make it look smooth

# Credits
credit to NustyFrozen and vanZeben,Umbranox (for the copied source) and metroframework for the UI and big thanks to modelsaber and beatsaver for their easy api that they totally didnt said i'm allowed to use (but they didn't said i'm not allowed to use ;D)


# installation
open it once and put your game directory folder and click apply then everything will work!


# Source Installation
you might need to import the nuget right click on the project and click Manage NuGet Packages
go to browse and type MetroModernUI and click install that's all
